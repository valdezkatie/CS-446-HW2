Questions:
a) When trying different threads and ammounts of numbers I found that the time
does not change much. The final time is usually around 1ms little bit less or more
but of course the more numbers there are the longer it takes. I also noticed that the 
more threads there are the longer it takes but that could be an error in my calculation.
b) The behavior makes sense since these threads are not truly working at the same time they
start and stop following the thread prevois to it which causes it to take time. Along with
this the more numbers it has to calculate makes it take longer.
c) The critical ection refers to the area where the threads are functioning but not
at the same time. For this I made sure that the start and stop indexes reliad on the thread count. 
If there were 2 threads thread 1 would go then thread 2 would go after thread one was finished.
Extra: If I had to make a guess as to what would happen I feel like that transfer
might not be possible if its expecting an array of ints to add together or it might loop over the same thread
over and over again.
